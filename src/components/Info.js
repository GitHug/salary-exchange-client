    Do you get your salary in another currency than the country you are currently living?

    Or are you perhaps planning a trip and want to get an indication when it might be a
    good time to exchange your currency?

    Then this is the tool for you!

    Add the currency you currently have to the left and the currency you want to convert
    to the right.

    Then just specify the amount and, presto, a graph showing the exchange rate for the
    specified period.
    </p>
  </div>
